If using python for exposing or utilizing open ai APIs/methods, simply follow the following steps:

* Create a static folder alongside venv (assuming Pycharm is used)
* Place index.html, styles.css, and app.js files into that folder.
* You will need to change the port in app.js. 
* CORS will need to be handled for both the python apis exposed on port 5000 (check previous repo) and methods accessed via port 63324.
